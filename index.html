# Goals of the sprint

Lesson specific:
* Create a follow-on lesson from [HPC Intro](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro)
  that targets workflows
* Rework workflow tasks to be consistent with previous lesson
  * Workflow objective will be to generate a scaling plot
* Make the lesson adaptable to multiple sites

General:
* See if sprints are a good model for developing HPC Carpentry lessons
