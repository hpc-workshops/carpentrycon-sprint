# Reminder: Code of Conduct

We use [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

???

Sprint carries on over a couple of weeks and (hopefully!) involves lots of
interaction...so this is important!

# Goals of the sprint

Lesson specific:
* Create a follow-on lesson from [HPC Intro](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro)
  that targets workflows
* Rework workflow tasks to be consistent with previous lesson
  * Workflow objective will be to generate a scaling plot
* Make the lesson adaptable to multiple sites

General:
* See if sprints are a good model for developing HPC Carpentry lessons

## Your Computer

.center[
  ![Standalone computers (banana for scale)](fig/jargon_standalone.svg)
]

* Private: user at the keyboard expects sole use of the machine
* Flexible: easy to install software or reconfigure for new tasks
* Responsive: open any program and immediately start using it

???

Whether your computer has one account or many, when your hands are on the
keyboard and mouse, you are in control of the machine. It's easy to install new
software, upgrade or remove existing programs, and even swap hardware in or out
to suit your needs. When you launch a program, it starts immediately. The
output is displayed on-screen, often with an option to save your work. If a
program is slow, you can halt competing programs to try making it faster.

## Working with Computer Clusters

.center[
  ![Schematic HPC workflow](fig/jargon_workflow.png)
]

* Remote: you connect over the Internet to the cluster _gateway_, which handles
  authentication and file transfers

* Queued: you submit a _job_ to the _scheduler_, which sets your program to
  launch as soon as adequate resources come available on one or more computers

* Shared: many jobs run simultaneously on the cluster, and each of its
  computers runs many different programs at once

???

While your computer may have high-performance components, "HPC" usually refers
to clusters of computers. Clusters are inherently shared resources: each
computer runs many programs at once, on behalf of several different users, and
large programs are distributed across several computers to break up the load.

From your computer, you access a cluster over the Internet through a gateway
computer. Rather than launching your program directly, you must request an
allocation of processors, memory and time. A scheduler will determine whether
one or several computers can satisfy your request, and the soonest time slot
when the resources are expected to become available. If nobody else is using
those computers, your program will launch immediately. Otherwise, it enters a
queue and will launch as soon as the computers have finished running other
users' jobs.

# Introducing HPC Carpentry

???

So let's talk about HPC Carpentry!

---
<div class="hpc-head">
  <img src="fig/hpc-logo.png" alt="HPC Carpentry logo" style="height: 100%;"/>
</div>

## Why "HPC Carpentry"?

* High performance computing is accessible at most institutions: clusters are
  built from off-the-shelf computer hardware

* Interacting with a remote HPC resource is not intuitive, and as apps and
  cloud platforms spread, it is becoming even less approachable

* Excellent training materials, documentation, and experts are out there, but
  access to HPC education has not kept pace with demand

* The Carpentries' approach — live, hands-on instruction, with artifacts that
  still work afterwards — has proven remarkably effective at both education
  and community building

Why HPC Carpentry?

Over the decades, the cost of building a high-performance computing cluster has
fallen: they are, after all, built from regular computer hardware. Most
academic and research institutions have at least one, with access readily
granted to research groups and students. Training materials, documentation, and
expert knowledge have also grown, but access to this knowledge has not scaled
nearly as well as the hardware.

The HPC Carpentry community grew as administrators and practitioners sought to
guide users through this gap and develop a training program that could be
reused by others. The Carpentries' approach to hands-on instruction builds
muscle memory and leaves learners with high-quality code after the workshop.
Lessons from established Carpentries curricula in related domains provide an
excellent foundation for us to build on.

## The HPC Carpentry Community

* Started in 2016 & 2017 by Peter Steinbach (Max Planck &#127465;&#127466;),
  Jeff Stafford, John Simpson, Alex Razoumov (ComputeCanada
  &#127464;&#127462;), and others

* Our __vision__ is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and
  coding skills for HPC resources.
  
* Our __mission__ is to lower the barrier to entry to HPC operations for a wide
  range of users, so that more people can benefit from the increasing
  availability of increasingly sophisticated computer systems.

* Our __strategy__ to achieve this goal is to develop and aggregate educational
  resources and work closely with like-minded communities.

* Our Steering Committee, elected annually, is
  
  * Alan O'Cais — CECAM, Spain &#127466;&#127480;
  * Andrew Reid — NIST, USA &#127482;&#127480;
  * Annajiat Alim Rasel — BracU, Bangladesh &#127463;&#127465;
  * Rohit Goswami — Quansight & U. Iceland &#127470;&#127480;
  * Trevor Keller — NIST, USA &#127482;&#127480;
  * Wirawan Purwanto — ODU, USA &#127482;&#127480;

???

The HPC Carpentry Community was created by Peter Steinbach in 2016, with a lot of
early contributions from people at ComputeCanada. We have met online twice a
month since summer of 2019 to coordinate lesson development efforts and grow
the community, with strong representation from around the globe.

Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and
coding skills for HPC resources.

Our mission is to lower the barrier to entry to HPC operations for a wide
range of users, so that more people can benefit from the increasing
availability of increasingly sophisticated computer systems.

Our strategy to achieve this goal is to develop and aggregate educational
resources and work closely with like-minded communities.

Our Steering Committee seats six members elected in the Spring each year
following an asynchronous, GitHub-based democratic process. The geographic
diversity of the committee reflects the global nature of our efforts.

## Lesson Programs

A workshop for novice HPC users comprises the following lessons:

* [The Unix Shell][shell-novice] from Software Carpentry (prerequisite)

  Novice command-line users learn how to navigate the filesystem, copy and move
  files and directories, write loops, and create simple shell scripts.

* [Introduction to High-Performance Computing][hpc-intro]

  Novice HPC users connect to their cluster, find out what resources are
  available, write a job script, monitor jobs in the queue, and retrieve output
  data when jobs finish.

* [High-Performance Computing Workflows with Snakemake][hpc-workflows]

  HPC users practice interacting with the scheduler, and learn how to build
  a repeatable workflow to generate and analyze data on the cluster.

A follow-up workshop can introduce the learners to more advanced topics on
writing or optimizing parallel software:

* [HPC Parallelisation For Novices][hpc-parallel]
* [Running LAMMPS on HPC systems][hpc-lammps]
* [Introduction to High-Performance Computing with Chapel][hpc-chapel]

???

Most interactions with the cluster are made through the command line, so the
lesson on UNIX Shell from Software Carpentries is a prerequisite for all our
lessons. In fact, we recommend teaching it as the first lesson in an HPC
Carpentry workshop for novice users. With a strong foundation on the command
line, learners can then connect to their cluster, find out how many computers
there are and whether any are available, write and submit their first job
scripts, then retrieve output data when their program finishes. Following these
fundamental interactions, these HPC users can learn how to manage dependencies
between data generation and analysis on the cluster, write an automated
workflow script, and use it to learn how much performance a program gains for
each additional processor they throw at it.

Instructors can offer follow-up lessons and workshops to cover topics in
parallel programming and performance optimization. We currently have lessons
using the Python and Chapel programming languages, as well as the popular
molecular dynamics software, LAMMPS. As we develop more advanced lessons, it
will become easier to stack these modules together to customize a workshop to
meet your learners exactly where their skills and interests intersect.
